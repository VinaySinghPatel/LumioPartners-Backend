his is the backend of the Lumio Partners project, built using Node.js and Express.js. To run it locally, ensure you have Node.js (v16 or later) installed. Clone the repository, navigate into the backend folder, and install dependencies using npm install. Create a .env file in the root directory to store environment variables like database credentials, API keys, and ports (e.g., PORT=5000). Start the server with node index.js or npm start. The backend will run on the port specified in .env (default: http://localhost:5000) and will handle API requests for the frontend. Keep your .env file secure and out of version control.
